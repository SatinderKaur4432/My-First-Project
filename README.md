# My-First-Project-Power BI   
This is my first project on Github.
# Project Overview
This Power BI project was developed for a leading department store operating within Portugal's e-commerce ecosystem, which acts as a central marketplace connecting hundreds of small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) from across the country. The department store serves as a single point of contact, streamlining business processes for merchants and offering a unified platform to showcase, manage, and sell their products to a broader customer base.

The core objective of this project was to design a comprehensive, interactive, and professional-grade Power BI dashboard that would provide clear visibility into key business metrics and performance indicators across the platform.
